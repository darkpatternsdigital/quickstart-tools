# DpdEmptySln

This is a basic .NET/pnpm starter.

- Ensure `pnpm` is available on your path. Using >=9.10.0, you can control the pnpm and node versions from the package.json.
- Builds and lints via the `dotnet` cli.

## Build

Run the following command:

```sh
dotnet build
```

### Run

TODO: Varies by application, but is likely something along the lines of:

```sh
cd Server/
dotnet run
```

or

```sh
pnpm start
```
